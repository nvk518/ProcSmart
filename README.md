### Developer TODO plans

- Incorporate password protected JSON reports only accessible by an educator
- Implement an instructor login and profile that allows for all recordings and reports to be viewable at once
- Implement a student login and profile that tracks all upcoming exams
- Create exam windows that are only accessible for recording during a set time period
- Allow for an optional toggle to show (at educator's discretion) whether a submitted video has been downloaded by an educator and when it has been safely deleted, thus increasing privacy
